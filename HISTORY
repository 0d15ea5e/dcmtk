HISTORY

In 1993, Institute OFFIS & Oldenburg University, Germany 
together with CERIUM, Rennes, France agreed to jointly develop a DICOM 
implementation on behalf of CEN/TC251/WG4 as part of a DICOM demonstration
at RSNA'93.  The software started with a early version of the DICOM
Upper Layer Protocol software library developed by the Mallinckrodt
Institute of Radiology in St. Louis, USA.  The rest of this software
was developed independently and successfully demonstrated at RSNA'93.
Interoperability was demonstrated with around 20 implementations from 
vendors of medical imaging equipment with both this software and the 
Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology's own implementation.

This implementation became known as the European CTN (Central Test Node).

The European CTN software was further extended in 1994 and 1995
and used as part of DICOM demonstrations at EuroPACS'94 in Geneva, 
ECR'95 in Vienna and CAR'95 in Berlin where even more vendors of 
imaging equipment were able to demonstrate interoperability.

During 1996 the software has been rewritten to use a new C++
based DICOM encoding/decoding library (dcmdata).  Software configuration 
is now done using the GNU Configure system.  

It has also been supplemented with a Modality Worklist CTN, demonstrated 
for the first time at CAR'96 in Paris, France.

This software package has been renamed DCMTK (DiCoM ToolKit).

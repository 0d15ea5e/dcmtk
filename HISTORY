HISTORY

In 1993, Institute OFFIS & Oldenburg University, Germany 
together with CERIUM, Rennes, France agreed to jointly develop a DICOM 
implementation on behalf of CEN/TC251/WG4 as part of a DICOM demonstration
at RSNA'93.  The software was based on a early version of the DICOM
Upper Layer Protocol software library developed by the Mallinckrodt
Institute of Radiology in St. Louis, USA.  The rest of this software
was developed independently and successfully demonstrated at RSNA'93.
Interoperability was demonstrated with around 20 implementations from 
vendors of medical imaging equipment with both this software and the 
Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology's own implementation.

This implementation became known as the European CTN (Central Test Node).

The European CTN software was then used as part of DICOM demonstrations
at EuroPACS'94 in Geneva, ECR'95 in Vienna and CAR'95 in Berlin.

During 1996 the software has been partly rewritten to use a new C++
based DICOM encoding/decoding library.  It has also been supplemented
with a Modality Worklist CTN to be demonstrated for the first time
at CAR'96 in Paris.

This software package has been renamed DCMTK (DICOM ToolKit).

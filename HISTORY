 
The OFFIS DICOM Toolkit DCMTK

In 1993, Institute OFFIS & Oldenburg University, Germany supported by 
CERIUM, Rennes, France, developed a DICOM implementation on behalf of 
CEN/TC251/WG4 as part of a DICOM demonstration at RSNA'93. The software 
started with a early version of the DICOM Upper Layer Protocol facility 
developed by the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology in St. Louis, USA. The 
rest of this software was developed independently and successfully 
demonstrated for the first time at RSNA'93. Interoperability was 
demonstrated with around 20 implementations from vendors of medical imaging 
equipment, with both this software and the Mallinckrodt Institute of 
Radiology's own implementation. This implementation became known as the 
European CTN (Central Test Node). 

The European CTN software was further extended by OFFIS in 1994 and 1995 
and used as part of DICOM demonstrations at EuroPACS'94 in Geneva, ECR'95 
in Vienna and CAR'95 in Berlin where even more vendors of imaging equipment 
were able to demonstrate interoperability. 

During 1996 the software was rewritten by OFFIS to use a new C++ based 
DICOM encoding/decoding library and has been supplemented with a Modality 
Worklist CTN, demonstrated for the first time at CAR'96 in Paris, France. 
The CAR'96 DICOM demonstration featured Modality Worklist Management and 
Image Storage/Query/Retrieval. The available software includes source code 
and documentation for the worklist management and image 
storage/query/retrieve server applications, a number of test applications, 
and the necessary libraries. A similar industry demonstrations also took 
place at the European Congress of Radiology (ECR '97) in Vienna and at 
CAR'97 in Berlin. 

Beginning with release 3.0 (1996), the software package was renamed to 
DCMTK (DiCoM ToolKit). It contains a number of improvements over the 
"European CTN" software previously available from OFFIS/Oldenburg 
University, the most important being: 
  - configuration using GNU-Configure 
  - a modality worklist SCP and SCU 
  - a new C++ encoding/decoding library 
  - support for offline media 
  - support for explicit VR transfer syntaxes 
  - a user-extensible data dictionary 
  - support for all balloted image SOP classes 

In 1997 a tool allowing to create DICOMDIRs according to the "General Purpose
CD-R Image Interchange Profile" was added. This tool was used to master
the CAR' 97 and NEMA '97 DICOM Demonstration CDs.

In 1998/99 new libraries for efficient rendering of DICOM grayscale images,
display calibration according to DICOM part 14 and an implementation of
the draft Grayscale Softcopy Presentation State supplement were added
and demonstrated at ECR '99


In addition to the freely available DCMTK software, OFFIS have also 
developed other DICOM software which must be licensed separately. These 
separate packages build on the facilities provided by DCMTK.

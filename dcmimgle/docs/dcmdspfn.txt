NAME

    dcmdspfn


SYNOPSIS

    dcmdspfn [options] lutfile-in


SUMMARY

    Command line program converts DCMTK monitor LUT file to tabbed text file
    describing the characteristic curve (CC), the display function and the
    post-standardized curve (PSC) for a 8 bit display. The 256 values of each
    curve can be visualized by a common spread sheet program (e.g. Microsoft
    Excel).


USAGE

    dcmdspfn [options] lutfile-in

    parameters:
      lutfile-in  text file describing the monitor characteristic

    general options:
      -h   --help     print this help text and exit
      -v   --verbose  verbose mode, print processing details
      -q   --quiet    quiet mode, print no warnings and errors
      -d   --debug    debug mode, print debug information

    output options:
      -Og  --gsdf     [f]ilename : string
                      write GSDF curve data to file f
      -Oc  --cielab   [f]ilename : string
                      write CIELAB curve data to file f


FORMAT

    The output file describing the CC, GSDF or CIELAB and PSC for a 8 bit
    display system (monitor) is a simple text file. Lines starting with a '#'
    are treated as comments and therefore skipped as well as blank lines.
    This conversion program creates such a file automatically (including some
    comment lines) by transforming the information stored in the DCMTK monitor
    LUT file (input, e.g. created by 'dconvlum').
    The ambient light value possibly defined in the LUT file is also used for
    the calculation. In this case the value is part of the file comment header
    as well as the number of DDL (device driving level) values and the absolute
    luminance range (measured in candela per square meter) and the range of
    the JND index (just noticable difference) in case of GSDF.

    See DICOM standard part 14 for more details on display calibration and
    Bartens model (including GSDF).

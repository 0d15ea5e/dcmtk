NAME

    dcmdspfn


SYNOPSIS

    dcmdspfn [options]


SUMMARY

Command line program converts DCMTK monitor LUT file to tabbed text file
describing the characteristic curve (CC), the display function and the post-
standardized curve (PSC) for an 8 bit display. The 256 values of each curve can
be visualized by a common spread sheet program (e.g. Microsoft Excel).
Above that the display curve (without CC and PSC) can also be computed for a
specified luminance range (min/max) and a certain number of Device Driving
Levels (DDL).


USAGE

dcmdspfn: Export standard display curves to a text file
usage: dcmdspfn [options]

general options:
  -h   --help       print this help text and exit
  -v   --verbose    verbose mode, print processing details
  -q   --quiet      quiet mode, print no warnings and errors
  -d   --debug      debug mode, print debug information
input options:
  +If  --lut-file   [f]ilename : string
                    text file describing the monitor characteristic
  +Il  --lum-range  [m]in max : float
                    minimum and maximum luminance (cd/m^2)
creation options:
  +Ca  --amb-light  [a]mbient light : float
                    ambient light value (cd/m^2, default: 0)
  +Cd  --ddl-count  [n]umber of DDLs : integer
                    number of Device Driving Levels (default: 256,
                    only with +Il)
output options:
  +Og  --gsdf       [f]ilename : string
                    write GSDF curve data to file f
  +Oc  --cielab     [f]ilename : string
                    write CIELAB curve data to file f


FORMAT

The output file describing the CC, GSDF or CIELAB and PSC for an 8 bit display
system (monitor) is a simple text file. Lines starting with a '#' are treated
as comments and therefore skipped as well as blank lines. This conversion
program creates such a file automatically (including some comment lines) by
transforming the information stored in the DCMTK monitor LUT file (input, e.g.
created by 'dconvlum').
The ambient light value possibly defined in the LUT file is also used for the
calculation. In this case the value is part of the file comment header as well
as the number of DDL (device driving level) values and the absolute luminance
range (measured in candela per square meter) and the range of the JND index
(just noticable difference) in case of GSDF. Alternatively the ambient light
value can be specified as a command line option. When setting the two luminance
values instead of reading a monitor characteristic file as input the luminance
range is linearly divided by the number of DDLs.

See DICOM standard part 14 for more details on display calibration and Bartens
model (including GSDF).

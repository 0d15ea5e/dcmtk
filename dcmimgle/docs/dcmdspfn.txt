NAME

    dcmdspfn


SYNOPSIS

    dcmdspfn [options]


SUMMARY

Command line program converts a DCMTK monitor/printer characteristics file to
tabbed text file describing the characteristic curve (CC), the display
function and the post-standardized curve (PSC) for an 8 bit display.  The 256
values of each curve can be visualized by a common spread sheet program (e.g.
Microsoft Excel).  Above that the display curve (without CC and PSC) can also
be computed for a specified luminance/OD range (min/max) and a certain number
of Device Driving Levels (DDL).

FORMAT

The output file describing the CC, GSDF or CIELAB and PSC for an 8 bit display
system (monitor or printer) is a simple text file.  Lines starting with a '#'
are treated as comments and, therefore, skipped as well as blank lines.  An
input file can for instance be created by the command line tool 'dconvlum'.

The ambient light value possibly defined in the characteristics file is also
used for the calculation.  In this case the value is part of the file comment
header as well as the number of DDL (device driving level) values and the
absolute luminance range (measured in candela per square meter) and the range
of the JND index (just noticable difference) in case of GSDF.  Alternatively,
the ambient light value can be specified as a command line option.  When
setting the two luminance values instead of reading a monitor characteristic
file as input the luminance range is linearly divided by the number of DDLs.

For printers the illumination can be specified in addition to the reflected
ambient light (both in the characteristics file and on the command line). The
header of the output file includes the minimum and maximum Optical Density
(OD) instead of the luminance range.  Please note that the OD values in the
input file have to be ordered in descending order (in contrast to the
luminance values used for monitors).  The DDL value 0 always means black
(darkest value) and the maximum DDL value means white (brightest value, clear
film).

The "tests" folder contains a sample characteristics file for both monitors
and printers.  See DICOM standard part 14 for more details on display
calibration and Bartens model (including GSDF).

NAME

    dcmgsdf


SYNOPSIS

    dcmgsdf in-file out-file


SUMMARY

    Command line program converts DCMTK monitor LUT file to tabbed text file
    describing the characteristic curve (CC), the graysscale standard display
    function (GSDF) and the post-standardized curve (PSC) for a 8 bit display.
    The 256 values of each curve can be visualized by a common spread sheet
    program (e.g. Microsoft Excel).


USAGE

    dcmgsdf in-file out-file
    
    in-file:  DCMTK monitor LUT (filename)
    out-file: tabbed text file (filename)
    

FORMAT

    The output file describing the CC, GSDF and PSC for a 8 bit display system
    (monitor) is a simple text file. Lines starting with a '#' are treated as
    comments and therefore skipped as well as blank lines.
    This conversion program creates such a file automatically (including some
    comment lines) by transforming the information stored in the DCMTK monitor
    LUT file (input).
    The ambient light value possibly defined in the LUT file is also used for
    the calculation. In this case the value is part of the file comment header
    as well as the number of DDL (device driving level) values, the absolute
    luminance range (measured in candela per square meter) and the range of
    the JND index (just noticable difference).

    See DICOM standard part 14 for more details on display calibration and
    Bartens model (including GSDF).

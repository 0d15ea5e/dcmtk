NAME

    dccielab


SYNOPSIS

    dccielab in-file out-file


SUMMARY

    Command line program converts DCMTK monitor LUT file to tabbed text file
    describing the characteristic curve (CC), the CIE Lab function and the
    post-standardized curve (PSC) for a 8 bit display. The 256 values of each
    curve can be visualized by a common spread sheet program (e.g. Microsoft
    Excel).


USAGE

    dccielab in-file out-file

    in-file:  DCMTK monitor LUT (filename)
    out-file: tabbed text file (filename)


FORMAT

    The output file describing the CC, CIELAB and PSC for a 8 bit display
    system (monitor) is a simple text file. Lines starting with a '#' are
    treated as comments and therefore skipped as well as blank lines.
    This conversion program creates such a file automatically (including some
    comment lines) by transforming the information stored in the DCMTK monitor
    LUT file (input).
    The ambient light value possibly defined in the LUT file is also used for
    the calculation. In this case the value is part of the file comment header
    as well as the number of DDL (device driving level) values and the absolute
    luminance range (measured in candela per square meter).

    See DICOM standard part 14 for more details on display calibration.

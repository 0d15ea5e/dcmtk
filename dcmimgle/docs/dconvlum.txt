NAME

    dconvlum


SYNOPSIS

    dconvlum in-file out-file [ambient]


SUMMARY

    Command line program converts VeriLUM file with characteristic curve
    data (CCx_xx.dat) to a format used for the Barten transformation in
    this toolkit.
    VeriLUM is a calibration package from ImageSmiths consisting of a
    photometer (with serial RS232 connector) and a Windows NT software.


USAGE

    dconvlum in-file out-file [ambient]
    
    in-file:  VeriLUM characteristic curve (filename)
    out-file: DCMTK monitor LUT (filename)
    ambient:  ambient light (optional floating point value)
    

FORMAT

    The output file describing the characteristic curve of a display system
    (monitor) is a simple text file. Lines starting with a '#' are treated
    as comments and therefore skipped as well as blank lines.
    This conversion program creates such a file automatically (including some
    comment lines) by transforming the information stored in the VeriLUM file.
    The number following the magic word "max" defines the maximum DDL value
    (e.g. 255 for 8 bit displays). This definition is required before the
    luminance data can be defined.
    Optionally the ambient light value can be specified in this file too.
    The floating point value (in candela per square meter) must follow the
    word "amb".
    Finally the luminance values are defined for each corresponding DDL
    (device driving level) value. The entries do not necessarily have to be
    ordered or complete, i.e. there can be less than 'max' + 1 entries.
    Missing values are calculated by cubic spline interpolation.

    See DICOM standard part 14 for more details on display calibration and
    Bartens model (including GSDF).

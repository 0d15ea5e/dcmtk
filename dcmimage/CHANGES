- Added new application dcm2pnm.
  dcm2pnm allows to convert DICOM images to the widely used
  PPM/PGM general purpose image format.
  dcm2pnm gives access to most functionality offered by the dcmimage
  library. It replaces the older (and far less powerful) applications
  di2mono, di2ppm, diclip, discale and disize.

**** Unreleased Changes from 97.05.16 (barth)

- Revised handling of GroupLength elements and support of 
  DataSetTrailingPadding elements. The enumeratio E_GrpLenEncoding
  got additional enumeration values (for a description see dctypes.h).

**** Unreleased Changes from 97.05.13 (eichelberg)

- Added new application dcm2pnm.
  dcm2pnm allows to convert DICOM images to the widely used
  PPM/PGM general purpose image format.
  dcm2pnm gives access to most functionality offered by the dcmimage
  library. It replaces the older (and far less powerful) applications
  di2mono, di2ppm, diclip, discale and disize.

  which takes an open stream instead of a file name as first argument.

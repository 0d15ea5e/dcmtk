
NAME

   wlmscpfs


SYNOPSIS

   wlmscpfs [options] port


SUMMARY

The wlmscpfs application implements a Service Class Provider (SCP) for the
Basic Worklist Management Service. The application will listen on a specified
TCP/IP port for incoming association requests from a Worklist Management SCU.
In case an association was acknowledged and a worklist query was received, the
wlmscpfs application will query particular files in a certain directory (which
can be specified through corresponding program options) on the file system for
corresponding worklist information, and it will send this information back to
the calling Worklist Management SCU. Aside from dealing with Worklist
Management queries, the wlmscpfs application also supports the Verification
Service Class as an SCP.

OPTIONS

The semantic impacts of the above mentioned options is clear for the majority
of options. Some particular options, however, are so specific that they need
detailed descriptions which will be given in this passage.

The returned character set options are intended for situations in which the
wlmscpfs application will return attribute values which are not composed of
characters from the Dicom default character repertoire. In such cases, for
example option --return-iso-ir-100 can be used to specify that a response to a
modality's worklist management C-Find request shall always contain Dicom's
Specific Character Set attribute (0008,0005) with a corresponding value, indi-
cating the character repertoire from which the characters of returned attribute
values were taken (in this example the repertoire ISO IR 100). Please note that
the wlmscpfs application will not make sure that all returned values are
actually made up of this character repertoire; the application expects this to
be the case. Option --return-iso-ir-100 will only lead to the inclusion of
the Specific Character Set attribute (0008,0005) with a corresponding value
in a worklist management C-Find response.


DICOM CONFORMANCE

The wlmscpfs application supports the following SOP Classes as an SCP:

    VerificationSOPClass                             "1.2.840.10008.1.1"

    FINDModalityWorklistInformationModel             "1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.31"

The wlmscpfs application will accept presentation contexts for all of the
abovementioned supported SOP Classes using any of the transfer syntaxes:

    LittleEndianImplicitTransferSyntax               "1.2.840.10008.1.2"
    LittleEndianExplicitTransferSyntax               "1.2.840.10008.1.2.1"
    BigEndianExplicitTransferSyntax                  "1.2.840.10008.1.2.2"

The default behaviour of the wlmscpfs application is to prefer transfer
syntaxes having an explicit encoding over the default implicit transfer syntax.
If wlmscpfs is running on big-endian hardware it will prefer BigEndianExplicit-
TransferSyntax over LittleEndianExplicitTransferSyntax (and vice versa). This
behaviour can be changed with the --prefer options (see above).

The wlmscpfs application does not support extended negotiation.


ENVIRONMENT

The wlmscpfs application will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries specified
in the DCMDICTPATH environment variable.  By default, if the DCMDICTPATH
environment variable is not set, the file /usr/local/dicom/lib/dicom.dic will
be loaded.  The default behaviour should be preferred and the DCMDICTPATH
environment variable only used when alternative data dictionaries are required.
The DCMDICTPATH environment variable has the same format as the shell PATH
variable in that a colon (":") separates entries.  The data dictionary code
will attempt to load each file specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment
variable.  It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.

NAME

   wlmscpfs


SYNOPSIS

   wlmscpfs [options] port


SUMMARY

The wlmscpfs application implements a Service Class Provider (SCP) for the
Basic Worklist Management Service. The application will listen on a specified
TCP/IP port for incoming association requests from a Worklist Management SCU.
In case an association was acknowledged and a worklist query was received, the
wlmscpfs application will query particular files in a certain directory (which
can be specified through corresponding program options) on the file system for
corresponding worklist information, and it will send this information back to
the calling Worklist Management SCU. Aside from dealing with Worklist
Management queries, the wlmscpfs application also supports the Verification
Service Class as an SCP.

          --no-fail              don't fail on an invalid query
          --sleep-after          [s]econds: integer
                                 sleep s seconds after find (default: 0)
          --sleep-during         [s]econds: integer

                                 set max receive pdu to n bytes (default: 16384)
    -dhl  --disable-host-lookup  disable hostname lookup
  group length encoding (when sending C-FIND response data):
    +g=   --group-length-recalc  recalculate group lengths if present (default)
    +g    --group-length-create  always write with group length elements
    -g    --group-length-remove  always write without group length elements
  length encoding in sequences and items (when sending C-FIND response data):
    +e    --length-explicit      write with explicit lengths (default)
    -e    --length-undefined     write with undefined lengths
encoding options:
  post-1993 value representations:
    +u    --enable-new-vr        enable support for new VRs (UN/UT) (default)
    -u    --disable-new-vr       disable support for new VRs, convert to OB


DICOM CONFORMANCE

The wlmscpfs application supports the following SOP Classes as an SCP:

    VerificationSOPClass                             "1.2.840.10008.1.1"

    FINDModalityWorklistInformationModel             "1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.31"

The wlmscpfs application will accept presentation contexts for all of the
abovementioned supported SOP Classes using any of the transfer syntaxes:

    LittleEndianImplicitTransferSyntax               "1.2.840.10008.1.2"
    LittleEndianExplicitTransferSyntax               "1.2.840.10008.1.2.1"
    BigEndianExplicitTransferSyntax                  "1.2.840.10008.1.2.2"

The default behaviour of the wlmscpfs application is to prefer transfer
syntaxes having an explicit encoding over the default implicit transfer syntax.
If wlmscpfs is running on big-endian hardware it will prefer BigEndianExplicit-
TransferSyntax over LittleEndianExplicitTransferSyntax (and vice versa). This
behaviour can be changed with the --prefer options (see above).

The wlmscpfs application does not support extended negotiation.


ENVIRONMENT

The wlmscpfs application will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries specified
in the DCMDICTPATH environment variable.  By default, if the DCMDICTPATH
environment variable is not set, the file /usr/local/dicom/lib/dicom.dic will
be loaded.  The default behaviour should be preferred and the DCMDICTPATH
environment variable only used when alternative data dictionaries are required.
The DCMDICTPATH environment variable has the same format as the shell PATH
variable in that a colon (":") separates entries.  The data dictionary code
will attempt to load each file specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment
variable.  It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.

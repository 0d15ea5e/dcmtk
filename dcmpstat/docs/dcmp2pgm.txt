   dcmp2pgm


SYNOPSIS

   dcmp2pgm [options] dcmimage_in [bitmap_out]


SUMMARY

The dcmp2pgm utility renders a monochrome DICOM image under the control of
a grayscale softcopy presentation state object into a monochrome bitmap
with 8 bits/pixel. The bitmap is stored either as "Portable Gray Map" (PGM)
or as a DICOM secondary capture image object. If no presentation state is
read from file, a default presentation state is created. The utility allows
to read a configuration file of the Softcopy Presentation State Viewer upon
startup. In this case, the settings from the configuration file affecting
the rendering of the presentation state are used, e.g. a correction of the
gray scale range according to Barten's model (DICOM part 14) can be
performed if the characteristic curve of the display system is available
and defined in the configuration file.


USAGE

dcmp2pgm: Read DICOM image and presentation state and render bitmap
usage: dcmp2pgm [options] dcmimage_in [bitmap_out]

parameters:
  dcmimage_in        input DICOM image
  bitmap_out         output DICOM image or PGM bitmap

general options:
  -h  --help         print this help text and exit
      --version      print version information and exit
  -v  --verbose      verbose mode, dump presentation state contents
  -d  --debug        debug mode, print debug information
processing options:
  -p  --pstate       [f]ilename: string
                     process using presentation state file
  -c  --config       [f]ilename: string
                     process using settings from configuration file
  -f  --frame        [f]rame: integer
                     process using image frame f (default: 1)
output format:
  -D  --pgm          save image as PGM (default)
  +D  --dicom        save image as DICOM secondary capture
output options:
  +S  --save-pstate  [f]ilename: string
                     save presentation state to file


ENVIRONMENT

The dcmp2pgm application will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries
specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment variable.  By default, if
the DCMDICTPATH environment variable is not set, the file
/usr/local/dicom/lib/dicom.dic will be loaded.  The default behaviour
should be preferred and the DCMDICTPATH environment variable only used
when alternative data dictionaries are required.  The DCMDICTPATH
environment variable has the same format as the shell PATH variable in
that a colon (":") separates entries.  The data dictionary code will
attempt to load each file specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment
variable.  It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.

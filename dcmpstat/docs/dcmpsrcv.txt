NAME

   dcmpsrcv


SYNOPSIS

   dcmpsrcv [options] config-file


SUMMARY

The dcmpsrcv application is invoked by the Grayscale Softcopy Presentation
State Viewer and is not intended to be invoked manually. The application
reads the common configuration file which is shared between the different
components of the viewer and opens a TCP/IP socket on which incoming
association requests are accepted. The application sparks a separate
process for each DICOM connection. It supports the same storage SOP classes
as the storescp utility as SCP, but does not support encapsulated transfer
syntaxes. Incoming images are stored in the common viewer database. See the
full conformance statement for further details.


USAGE

dcmpsrcv: Network receive for presentation state viewer
usage: dcmpsrcv [options] config-file

parameters:
  config-file      configuration file to be read

general options:
  -h    --help       print this help text and exit
        --version    print version information and exit
  -v    --verbose    verbose mode, print processing details
  -d    --debug      debug mode, print debug information
  -t    --terminate  terminate all running receivers


ENVIRONMENT

The dcmpsrcv application will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries
specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment variable.  By default, if
the DCMDICTPATH environment variable is not set, the file
/usr/local/dicom/lib/dicom.dic will be loaded.  The default behaviour
should be preferred and the DCMDICTPATH environment variable only used
when alternative data dictionaries are required.  The DCMDICTPATH
environment variable has the same format as the shell PATH variable in
that a colon (":") separates entries.  The data dictionary code will
attempt to load each file specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment
variable.  It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.

SYNOPSIS

   dcmmkcrv [options] dcmimg-in curvedata-in dcmimg-out


SUMMARY

The dcmmkcrv utility allows to create DICOM images containing curve data.
Since curve data is hardly used by vendors today, this is intended as a
means to test implementations that can read curve data. The utility reads an
existing DICOM image and a text file containing the curve data in textual
form. A DICOM curve data repeating group is created according to the
options specified on the command line, added to the existing image and
written back to file. The output file is encoded with the same transfer
syntax used for the input file. This utility only supports the creation of
two-dimensional curves.

    +r   --roi          create as ROI curve
  curve value representation:
    +v   --data-vr      [n]umber: integer 0..4 (default: 4)
                        select curve data VR: 0=US, 1=SS, 2=FL, 3=FD, 4=SL
    -c   --curve-vr     [n]umber: integer 0..2 (default: 0)
                        select VR with which the Curve Data element is written
                        0=VR according to --data-vr, 1=OB, 2=OW
  repeating group:
    -g   --group        [n]umber: integer 0..15 (default: 0)
                        select repeating group: 0=0x5000, 1=0x5002 etc.
  curve description:
    -l   --label        s: string
                        set Curve Label to s (default: absent)
    +d   --description  s: string
                        set Curve Description to s (default: absent)
    -a   --axis         x: string, y: string
                        set Axis Units to x\y (default: absent


SYNTAX OF THE CURVE DATA FILE

The curve data file is expected to be a plain ASCII text file containing
numbers (integer or floating point) comprising the values of the point
coordinates. Numbers must be separated by whitespace. No checking of the
value range or value range conversion is performed. Example:

256.451947 1.000000
477.689863 128.822080
128.822080 477.689863
35.310137 128.822080
256.451947 1.000000


ENVIRONMENT

The dcmmkcrv application will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries
specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment variable.  By default, if
the DCMDICTPATH environment variable is not set, the file
/usr/local/dicom/lib/dicom.dic will be loaded.  The default behaviour
should be preferred and the DCMDICTPATH environment variable only used
when alternative data dictionaries are required.  The DCMDICTPATH
environment variable has the same format as the shell PATH variable in
that a colon (":") separates entries.  The data dictionary code will
attempt to load each file specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment
variable.  It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.

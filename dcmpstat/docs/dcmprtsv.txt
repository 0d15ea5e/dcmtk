   dcmprtsv

SYNOPSIS

   dcmprtsv [options] [filename_in...]

SUMMARY

The dcmprtsv utility implements the DICOM Basic Grayscale Print Management 
Service Class as SCU. It also supports the optional Basic Annotation Box 
and Presentation LUT SOP Classes. The utility is intended for use within
the DICOMscope viewer.

The dcmprtsv utility takes complete print jobs consisting of a Stored Print 
object and one or more Hardcopy Grayscale objects and spools them to the 
printer.  No attempt is made to check whether the attributes defined in the 
Stored Print object are supported by the Print SCP. However, the print 
spooler will not attempt to use the optional Annotation or Presentation LUT 
services if they are not successfully negotiated with the Print SCP.

The dcmprtsv utility reads the characteristics of the printer to 
communicate with from the configuration file. Depending on the printer's 
support for Presentation LUT, any Presentation LUT present in the print job 
will be rendered into the hardcopy images before they are spooled to the 
printer if necessary.  If the printer does not support image transmission 
with 12 bits/pixel (as per the configuration file), the grayscale hardcopy 
images are down-sampled to 8 bits/pixel before transmission to the printer.

The dcmprtsv utility can be run either in "printer mode", in which case
the file name of a Stored Print object must be passed, or in "spool mode",
in which case commands are read periodically from a spool directory.

  +d  --dump          dump all DIMSE messages to stdout
      --noprint       do not create print-out (no n-action-rq)
mode options:
  +p  --print         printer mode, print file(s) and terminate (default)
  +s  --spool         [n]ame: string
                      spooler mode, use job prefix [n]
processing options:
  -c  --config        [f]ilename: string
                      process using settings from configuration file
  -p  --printer       [n]ame: string (default: 1st printer in cfg file)
                      select printer with identifier [n] from cfg file
spooler options (only with --spool):
      --sleep         [d]elay: integer (default: 1)
                      sleep [d] seconds between spooler checks
basic film session options (not with --spool):
      --copies        [v]alue: integer (1..100, default: 1)
                      set number of copies to [v]
      --medium-type   [v]alue: string
                      set medium type to [v]
      --destination   [v]alue: string
                      set film destination to [v]
      --label         [v]alue: string
                      set film session label to [v]
      --priority      [v]alue: string
                      set print priority to [v]
      --owner         [v]alue: string
                      set film session owner ID to [v]

ENVIRONMENT

The dcmprtsv application will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries
specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment variable.  By default, if
the DCMDICTPATH environment variable is not set, the file
/usr/local/dicom/lib/dicom.dic will be loaded.  The default behaviour
should be preferred and the DCMDICTPATH environment variable only used
when alternative data dictionaries are required.  The DCMDICTPATH 
environment variable has the same format as the shell PATH variable in
that a colon (":") separates entries.  The data dictionary code will
attempt to load each file specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment 
variable.  It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.

NAME

    dcmdump

SYNOPSIS

    dcmdump [options] dcmfile-in [options] dcmfile-in

SUMMARY

The dcmdump utility dumps the contents of a dicom file (file format or 
raw data set) to stdout (or stderr) in textual form.  Attributes with
very large value fields (e.g. pixel data) can be described as "(not loaded)".
String value fields will be delimited with square breackets ([]).  Known
UIDs will be displayed by their names prefixed by an equals sign 
(e.g. =MRImageStorage).  Empty value fields are described 
as "(no value available)".

If dcmdump reads a raw data set (dicom data without a file format 
meta-header) it will attempt to guess the transfer syntax by examining
the first few bytes of the file.  It is not always possible to correctly
guess the transfer syntax and it is better to convert a data set to
a file format whenever possible (using the dcmconv utility).  It is
also possible to use the -f and +t[ieb] options to force dcmdump to read
a dataset with a particular transfer syntax.

USAGE

dcmdump [options] dcmfile-in [options] dcmfile-in
Options are valid if specified before filename.
options are:

  input options:

    DICOM fileformat (Sup. 1) support:\n"
      -f      read file without metaheader.
              Transfer syntax discovery for datasets can fail so
              it can be desirable to try all transfer syntaxes if
	      an error occurs.
      +f      read file with metaheader (default)

    input transfer syntax (only with -f):
      Since a DICOM file with metaheader defines the transfer syntax
      in the metaheader,  this option is not allowed for input
      transfer syntaxes.
      -t=     try and discover input transfer syntax (can fail) (default)
      -ti     read with little-endian implicit transfer syntax 
      -te     read with little-endian explicit transfer syntax
      -tb     read with big-endian explicit transfer syntax

  output options:

    printing
      +E    print to stderr
      -E    print to stdout (default)
      +L    print long tag values 
      -L    do not print long tag values (default)
            The output length of a tag value is restricted 
            to 70 characters.
      +M    load very long tag values (default)
      -M    do not load very long tag values (e.g. pixel data)
            This option prevents the dump utility for loading
            very long tag values into memory. Tags values that are
            not loaded cannot be printed, so (not loaded) is printed
            in the output.

    search Tags
      +P tag    print all encountered instances of \"tag\" (where
                tag is \"xxxx,xxxx\" or a data dictionary name)
                this option can be specified multiple times
                default: the complete file is printed
      -P tag    only print first instance of \"tag\" (where
                tag is \"xxxx,xxxx\" or a data dictionary name)
                this option can be specified multiple times
                default: the complete file is printed
      +p        prepend sequence hierarchy to printed tag instance
                (only meaningful in conjunction with the +P or -P
                options), denoted by: (xxxx,xxxx).(xxxx,xxxx).*
      -p        do not prepend hierarchy to tag instance (default)

  other options:
      -h        print this usage string

ENVIRONMENT

The dcmdump utility will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries
specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment variable.  By default, if
the DCMDICTPATH environment variable is not set, the file
/usr/local/dicom/lib/dicom.dic will be loaded.  The default behaviour
should be preferred and the DCMDICTPATH environment variable only used
when alternative data dictionaries are required.  The DCMDICTPATH 
environment variable has the same format as the shell PATH variable in
that a colon (":") separates entries.  The data dictionary code will
attempt to load each file specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment 
variable.  It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.

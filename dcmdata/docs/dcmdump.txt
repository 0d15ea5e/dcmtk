NAME

    dcmdump

SYNOPSIS

    dcmdump [options] dcmfile-in [options] dcmfile-in

SUMMARY

The dcmdump utility dumps the contents of a dicom file (file format or 
raw data set) to the standard output in textual form.  Attributes with
very large value fields (e.g. pixel data) will be described as "(not loaded)".
String value fields will be delimited with square breackets ([]).  Known
UIDs will be displayed by their names prefixed by an equals sign 
(e.g. =MRImageStorage).  Empty value fields are described 
as "(no value available)".

If dcmdump reads a raw data set (dicom data without a file format 
meta-header) it will attempt to guess the transfer syntax by examining
the first few bytes of the file.  It is not always possible to correctly
guess the transfer syntax and it better to convert a data set to
a file format whenever possible (using the ds2file utility).

USAGE

usage: dcmdump [options] dcmfile-in [options] dcmfile-in
Options are valid if specified before filename.
options are:
  output option
    +E    print to stderr
    -E    print to stdout (default)
    +L    print long element values (default)
    -L    do not print long element values
  input option:
    +D    print dataset
    -D    print fileformat or dataset (default)
  input transfer syntax: use only after +D
    +t=   use transfer syntax recognition (default)
    +ti   read with little-endian implicit transfer syntax
    +te   read with little-endian explicit transfer syntax
    +tb   read with big-endian explicit transfer syntax
  other test/debug options:
    +l    force load of all input data into memory

ENVIRONMENT

The dcmdump utility will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries
specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment variable.  By default, if
the DCMDICTPATH environment variable is not set, the file
/usr/local/dicom/lib/dicom.dic will be loaded.  The default behaviour
should be preferred and the DCMDICTPATH environment variable only used
when alternative data dictionaries are required.  The DCMDICTPATH 
environment variable has the same format as the shell PATH variable in
that a colon (":") separates entries.  The data dictionary code will
attempt to load each file specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment 
variable.  It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.

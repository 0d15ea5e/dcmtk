    file2ds

SYNOPSIS

    file2ds [options] dcm-file dcm-dataset

SUMMARY

The file2ds utility reads a dicom file format (dcm-file)
and write a dicom data set to an output file (dcm-dataset).

USAGE

usage: file2ds [options] dcm-file dcm-dataset
options are:
  group length encoding:
    +g    write with group lengths (default)
    -g    write without group lengths
  length encoding in sequences and items:
    +e    write with explicit lengths (default)
    -e    write with undefined lengths
  output transfer syntax:
    +t=   write with same transfer syntax as input (default)
    +ti   write with little-endian implicit transfer syntax
    +te   write with little-endian explicit transfer syntax
    +tb   write with big-endian explicit transfer syntax
  other test/debug options:
    +V    verbose mode, print actions
    +v    validate input data (currently almost useless)
    +dn   set debug level to n (n=1..9)

ENVIRONMENT

The file2ds utility will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries
specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment variable.  By default, if
the DCMDICTPATH environment variable is not set, the file
/usr/local/dicom/lib/dicom.dic will be loaded.  The default behaviour
should be preferred and the DCMDICTPATH environment variable only used
when alternative data dictionaries are required.  The DCMDICTPATH 
environment variable has the same format as the shell PATH variable in
that a colon (":") separates entries.  The data dictionary code will
attempt to load each file specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment 
variable.  It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.

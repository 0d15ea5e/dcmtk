NAME

    dcmconv

SYNOPSIS

    dcmconv [options] dicomfile-in dcmfile-out

SUMMARY

The dcmconv utility reads a dicomfile (dicomfile-in),
performs an encoding conversion and writes the converted
data an output file (dicomfile-out).

USAGE

usage: dcmconv [options] dcmfile-in dcmfile-out
options are:
  group length encoding:
    +g    write with group lengths (default)
    -g    write without group lengths
  length encoding in sequences and items:
    +e    write with explicit lengths (default)
    -e    write with undefined lengths
  output transfer syntax:
    +t=   write with same transfer syntax as input (default)
    +ti   write with little-endian implicit transfer syntax
    +te   write with little-endian explicit transfer syntax
    +tb   write with big-endian explicit transfer syntax
  other test/debug options:
    +V    verbose mode, print actions
    +l    force load of all input data into memory
    +v    validate input data (currently almost useless)
    +c    copy all input data before writing output
    +dn   set debug level to n (n=1..9)

ENVIRONMENT

The dcmconv utility will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries
specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment variable.  By default, if
the DCMDICTPATH environment variable is not set, the file
/usr/local/dicom/lib/dicom.dic will be loaded.  The default behaviour
should be preferred and the DCMDICTPATH environment variable only used
when alternative data dictionaries are required.  The DCMDICTPATH 
environment variable has the same format as the shell PATH variable in
that a colon (":") separates entries.  The data dictionary code will
attempt to load each file specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment 
variable.  It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.

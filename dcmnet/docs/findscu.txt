NAME

    findscu

SYNOPSIS

findscu [options] peer port [queryfile ...]

SUMMARY

The findscu application implements an SCU for the Query/Retrieve
Service Class and the Basic Worklist Management Service Class.  
Findscu only supports query functionality using the C-FIND
message.  It sends query keys to an SCP and awaits responses.
The application can be used to test SCPs of the Query/Retrieve
and Basic Worklist Management Service Classes.  

USAGE

Invoking the findscu application without any parameters will 
cause it to display an invocation syntax summary.

The findscu application accepts the following command line
parameters and options:

findscu [-k key][-r n][-v][-d][-a][-b n][-P][-S][-O][-W]
        [-t ourAETitle][-c theirAETitle] peer port [queryfile ...]

parameters:
    peer        hostname of dicom peer
    port        tcp/ip port number of peer
    queryfile   matching keys (DICOM file)
options:
    -k key      override matching key (gggg,eeee=\"string\")
    -r n        repeat n times
    -v          verbose mode
    -d          debug mode
    -a          abort association
    -b n        set max receive pdu to n bytes (default: 16K)
    -P          use Patient Root Q/R Information Model
    -S          use Study Root Q/R Information Model
    -O          use Patient/Study Only Root Q/R Information Model
    -W          use Modality Worklist Information Model (default)
    -t title    my calling AE title (default: FINDSCU)
    -c title    called AE title of peer (default: ANY-SCP)

Each file supplied on the command line will be sent to the SCP
as part of a C-FIND request.  Each set of response identifers 
received will be printed to stdout.

Individual attributes of each file sent can be modified or
supplemented using the "-k key" option.  For example the 
command:

    findscu -k '0010,0010=HEWETT*' caesar 5678 patqry.dcm

will, when sent to the SCP caesar at TCP/IP port 5678, cause any
PatientsName attribute in patqry.dcm to have the value 'HEWETT*'. 
If such an attribute is present it will be replaced, if absent it
will be inserted.  The -k option can be present more than once.  
The value part (after the =) may be absent causing the attribute to
be sent with zero length.  It is not possible to replace or insert
attributes within sequences using the -k option.

DICOM CONFORMANCE

The findscu application supports the following SOP Classes 
as an SCU:

    FINDPatientRootQueryRetrieveInformationModel "1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.2.1.1"
    FINDStudyRootQueryRetrieveInformationModel	"1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.2.2.1"
    FINDPatientStudyOnlyQueryRetrieveInformationModel "1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.2.3.1"
    FINDModalityWorklistInformationModel	"1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.31"

The findscu application will propose presentation contexts for
one of the abovementioned supported SOP Classes depending
on command line options (-P, -S, -O or -W).  Each proposed
presentation context will propose the transfer syntaxes:

    LittleEndianImplicitTransferSyntax	"1.2.840.10008.1.2"
    LittleEndianExplicitTransferSyntax	"1.2.840.10008.1.2.1"
    BigEndianExplicitTransferSyntax	"1.2.840.10008.1.2.2"

The findscu application does not support extended negotiation.

ENVIRONMENT

The findscu application will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries
specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment variable.  By default, if
the DCMDICTPATH environment variable is not set, the file
/usr/local/dicom/lib/dicom.dic will be loaded.  The default behaviour
should be preferred and the DCMDICTPATH environment variable only used
when alternative data dictionaries are required.  The DCMDICTPATH 
environment variable has the same format as the shell PATH variable in
that a colon (":") separates entries.  The data dictionary code will
attempt to load each file specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment 
variable.  It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.

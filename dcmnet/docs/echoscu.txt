NAME

    echoscu

SYNOPSIS

    echoscu [-r n][-v][-d][-a][-b n][-t ourAETitle][-c theirAETitle] peer port

SUMMARY

The echoscu application implements a Service Class User (SCU) for the 
Verification SOP Class.  It sends a DICOM C-ECHO message to a Service
Class Provider (SCP) and waits for a response.  The application can be
used to verify basic DICOM connectivity.  

USAGE

Invoking the echoscu application without any parameters will cause it to 
display an invocation syntax summary.

The echoscu application command line parameters and options:

    echoscu [-r n][-v][-d][-a][-b n][-t ourAETitle][-c theirAETitle] peer port

parameters:
    peer        hostname of dicom peer
    port        tcp/ip port number of peer
options:
    -r n        repeat n times
    -v          verbose mode
    -d          debug mode
    -a          abort association
    -b n        set max receive pdu to n bytes (default: 16K)
    -t title    my calling AE title (default: ECHOSCU)
    -c title    called AE title of peer (default: ANY-SCP)

DICOM CONFORMANCE

The echoscu application supports the SOP Classes as an SCU:

    VerificationSOPClass	"1.2.840.10008.1.1"

The echoscu application will only propose the transfer syntax

    LittleEndianImplicitTransferSyntax	"1.2.840.10008.1.2"

ENVIRONMENT

The echoscu application will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries
specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment variable.  By default, if
the DCMDICTPATH environment variable is not set, the file
/usr/local/dicom/lib/dicom.dic will be loaded.  The default behaviour
should be preferred and the DCMDICTPATH environment variable only used
when alternative data dictionaries are required.  The DCMDICTPATH 
environment variable has the same format as the shell PATH variable in
that a colon (":") separates entries.  The data dictionary code will
attempt to load each file specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment 
variable.  It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.

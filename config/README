The config Directory
====================

The config directory includes configuration files for the dcmtk (Dicom Toolkit)
of OFFIS. The configuration mechanism uses the GNU autoconf / configure system.

Recommemded project directory structure:
========================================

dcmtk
	config
		include
		templates
	module1
		libsrc			# Library sources
		include			# include Directory
			module1
		apps			# Application programs
		tests			# Test programs
		docs			# documentation
	module2
	...

templates directory:
====================

If you use this structure, copy from the templates directory
	Makefile.module -> dcmtk/modulex/Makefile.in
	configure.module -> dcmtk/modulex/configure

They can be used without any changes if you are using the complete structure.

The files Makefile.include and Makefile.source are templates for 
the libsrc apps and tests part. They must be changed to reflect your special
module. They must be copied into the directories as Makefile.in


Anyway, you can look into the templates directory for examples using 
Makefiles for this configuration utilities.

DICOM TOOLKIT (DCMTK) INSTALLATION

PRE-REQUISITES

The DICOM ToolKit (DCMTK) needs to be compiled with a C++ compiler.
We recommend using the GNU-C++ compiler in versions higher than 2.7
(most of the development was done using GNU-C++ 2.95 on Solaris 7).
The software is also known to compile using the SUNPro C++ compiler,
the IBM C Set++ compiler and the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

Compatibility with other C++ compilers is unknown, however, we have
tried to keep language demands to a minimum (newer C++ features such
as ANSI C++ Library, Exceptions and RTTI have been avoided).

You will need around 100Mb of disk space to compile all the software.

SUPPORTED SYSTEMS

- Windows 95/98/2000/NT

The DCMTK software can be compiled under a native Windows95/NT environment.
More information and a ZIP archive containing project files for Microsoft
Visual C++ 5.0 can be found in the dcmtk/config/systems/win32 directory.

    Windows 9x     / Intel x86 / Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0
    Windows NT 4.0 / Intel x86 / Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0
    Windows NT 4.0 / Intel x86 / Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
    Windows 2000   / Intel x86 / Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0

The imagectn and wlistctn have been ported to Windows, but do not support
multi-processing (i.e. multiple clients concurrently) under Windows. The
ctndisp application requires the X-Window System. The Worklist WWW Scripts
require an http server and a perl interpreter and have not been tested
under Windows (file locking interaction with the wlistctn server may or may
not work).

    MacOS X 10.0.3 / Power Mac G4    / Apple gcc-926 (based on gcc 2.95.2 *6)

Earlier releases are known to also compile on the following platforms which
are not available to us for testing purposes:

    SunOS 4.1.3   / Sun Sparc       / Gnu gcc 2.7.2
    HP-UX 9.05    / HP PA 1.1       / Gnu gcc 2.7.2.1
    Linux 2.0.33  / Intel x86       / Gnu gcc 2.7.2.1
    IBM AIX 3.2   / RS 6000         / IBM AIX XL C++ Compiler/6000 V1.0

Platform Notes:

(*1) The NeXT gcc 2.5.8 compiler provides only very limited support for C++
     templates and, therefore, might fail to compile the dcmimage/dcmimgle
     module ("internal compiler error").  The gcc compiler also does not
     properly  support the "protected" derivation of classes which is used in
     the dcmsr module.  However, modules and applications that were present in
     earlier releases of DCMTK still compile.
(*2) Requires -DSIGNAL_HANDLER_WITH_ELLIPSE to be defined.
(*3) The dcmimage/dcmimgle module makes intensive use of inlined templates.
     Depending on the compiler and the available virtual memory, compilation
     might fail if this module is compiled with optimization.  Compilation
     succeeds if the optimizer and any automatic inlining of code are switched
     off.  For example Gnu gcc might require that the -O option is removed and
     -fno-default-inline is added in the CXXFLAGS setting in the file
     config/Makefile.def, which is created by configure (see below).
(*4) Requires -fpermissive when compiled with gcc due to the X11R5 header
     files which are not ANSI compliant.
(*5) IRIX 6 users are recommended to consult SGI's Notes on building
     Open Source software on IRIX, available from:
     http://toolbox.sgi.com/TasteOfDT/public/freeware/shared/howto.html
     In short, after running configure, the following modifications are required
     before DCMTK can be compiled:
     in config/Makefile.def:
       - remove "-lsocket -lnsl" from LIBS
     in config/Makefile.x:
       - remove "-lsocket -lnsl" from X_LIBS (if present)
       - remove "-L/usr/lib" from X_LIBS or X_LIBDIRS
     On IRIX, DCMTK should be built using GNU make (gmake), not with the IRIX
     specific pmake/smake/make commands.
     If you intend to compile DCMTK with OpenSSL support, you might need to 
     modify the compiler flags in config/Makefile.def - the following setting 
     has been reported to work:
       - set "CXXFLAGS= -O -D_REENTRANT -D_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED -D_BSD_SOURCE -D_BSD_COMPAT"
(*6) The SysV IPC implementation on MacOS X seems to be incomplete.
     This problem can be worked around by running configure and then manually
     modifying config/include/config.h:
       - remove the macro definition "#define HAVE_SEMCTL 1"
     After this modification, "make all" should succeed.

Please Note: Due to resource limitations it is not practical for us to
ensure that the newest release of DCMTK is problem free under all the above
combinations.  Our main development environment is SUN Solaris 7 using GNU
C++ 2.95 and DCMTK should always compile on this platform.


OPENSSL SUPPORT

Starting with release 3.4.2, DCMTK supports the "DICOM Security Enhancements
One", i.e. DICOM network transmission "tunneled" through a secure TLSv1
transport connection.  DCMTK relies on the OpenSSL toolkit (www.openssl.org)
for the underlying cryptographic routines and the TLS protocol
implementation.  This release of DCMTK is known to compile with OpenSSL
releases 0.9.5a to 0.9.6a.

If support for the security enhancements is desired, a compiled version of
the OpenSSL libraries and include files must be available during compilation
of DCMTK, and the OpenSSL support must be switched on explicitly.  By
default, DCMTK compiles without OpenSSL support and disables all security
enhancements.

To enable OpenSSL support when compiling for Windows, select the appropriate
target in the Visual C++ workspace.  You may have to adapt the include paths,
which expect OpenSSL in a directory named openssl-(version) on the same
directory level as the DCMTK root directory.  To enable OpenSSL support when
compiling for Unix, see description for Step 2 below.  We recommend that you
also read the documentation in dcmtk/dcmtls/docs about using TLS with DCMTK.


BUILDING

GNU autoconf is used to configure the software for the hardware / operating
system you are using.  You do not need to obtain GNU autoconf to compile
and install this software.  All the neccessary configure scripts are
included in this distribution.  The configure scripts examine your system
capabilities and automatically generate include files and Makefiles.

Perform the following steps from the top level (dcmtk) directory
to compile and install the software:

Step 1:
	cd config
	./rootconf
	cd ..

Step 1 generates a Makefile and a configure script in the top level dcmtk
directory.

Step 2:
	./configure

Step 2 executes the configure scripts in each subdirectory.  First the
system capabilities are examined and then Makefiles are generated.  By
default, executables and libraries will be installed (in Step 4) in the
directory /usr/local/dicom in the bin and lib subdirectories.  If you wish
to use another install prefix you can use the --prefix=<path> flag to
configure.  E.g., if you wish to install underneath your home directory in
~/dicom/bin and ~/dicom/lib then you should start configure as:

	./configure --prefix=$HOME/dicom

Step 2 is also the place where support for OpenSSL can be enabled. Use the
--with-openssl switch to enable OpenSSL support.  The --with-opensslinc option
allows to specify the directory in which OpenSSL is installed.  This is
usually the directory that has been used as --prefix when compiling OpenSSL.
For example, if you wish to enable the security enhancements, and OpenSSL is
installed in /usr/local/apps/openssl-0.9.6, then you should start configure as:

	./configure --with-openssl --with-opensslinc=/usr/local/apps/openssl-0.9.6

Different configure options can be combined in any order. configure --help
will print a list of all existing configure options.  Useful configure
options are:

  --enable-debug          compile with debug code, don't optimize
  --disable-debug         compile without debug code (default)
  --enable-threads=TYPE   compile with MT support (posix/solaris/auto=default)
  --disable-threads       compile without MT support

Step 3:
	make all

Step 3 will build the libraries and executables.  If you run into problems
see the section on PROBLEMS below.

Step 4:
	make install

Step 4 will install the executables and data dictionary.  If you also wish
to install the libraries and include files then use the "make install-lib".

Step 5:
	make distclean

Step 5 will revert the source tree to the state prior to Step 1.  If you
just want to get rid of object files and local executables use "make clean"
instead.


SOLVING CONFIGURATION AND COMPILATION PROBLEMS

The configure script might not be able to guess the correct compiler and
compiler flags to use.  For example, we have noticed that use of the
-pedantic flag to the GNU-C++ compiler causes compilation errors on some
systems (e.g. SunOS 4.1.3) due to system include files with incorrect ANSI
function prototypes.

You can set environment variables to initialize configure before it is
called (before Step 2 above):

  Set environment variable CXX to the name of your C++ compiler
  Set environment variable CXXFLAGS to the compile flags of your C++ compiler.
  Set environment variable LDFLAGS to your linker flags.
  Set environment variable CPPFLAGS to you preprocessor flags.

You do not need to specify all the above environment variables since
the default settings are sensible for most unix compilers.

If the configure script fails you may have to change the configuration
settings in the config directory.  See the config/docs directory for more
information.

See also the FAQ for more hints.


HTML DOCUMENTATION

A few DCMTK modules have been documented with DOC++, a free source code 
documentation system similar to javadoc (see http://docpp.sourceforge.net/). 
Users who have doc++ installed can create a hypertext documentation for these 
modules with "make html" in the module subdirectories.  At the current time, 
dcmimage, dcmimgle, dcmpstat, dcmsign, dcmsr and dcmtls are fully documented 
and ofstd is partially documented.  See FAQ entry: "Where is rest of the 
documentation?"

INSTALLATION OF THE DCMTK-System
================================

To install the DCMTK system you need the GNU-C++ compiler gcc in a
version higher than 2.5.8.

Then type in the following (from here):

1. cd config
2. ./rootconf
3. cd ..
4. ./configure
5. make dependencies	(optional)
6. make install

You need not to make new dependencies because a set of path relative
dependencies is included in the DCMTK-system.

If you use another compiler the following introduction can help
you. But we have not tested the DCMTK system with compilers other than
the GNU-C.

STEP 1-3 see above
4. Set environment variable CXX to the name of your C++ compiler
5. Set environment variable CC to the name your ANSI C compiler
6. Set environment variable CXXFLAGS to the compile flags of your C++
   compiler. 
7. Set environment variable CFLAGS to the compile flags of your C
   compiler.
8. Set environment variable LDFLAGS to your linker flags.
9. Set environment variable CPPFLAGS to you preprocessor flags.
10. ./configure
11. make install

Do not use "make dependencies" because this uses the proprietary
methods of the GNU C compiler. You do not need to specify all
environment variables in 6-9 since the default settings are sensible
for most unix compilers. If the configure script fails you must change
the configuration settings in the config directory. See the
config/docs directory for more information.

Have fun.

ANNOUNCEMENT

Version 3.6.9 of the OFFIS DCMTK (DICOM ToolKit) software is now available for
public release.  This release includes the following main changes over the
previous version 3.6.8:

- DCMTK 3.6.9 builds correctly on older and up-to-date versions of GNU gcc
  (9.5.0 to 14.2.0) Clang (14.0.6 to 18.1.8), Apple Clang (14.0.3 to 15.0.0),
  and Microsoft Visual Studio (2017 to 2022).

- Tested with the following operating systems/environments:
  - Android on arm64
  - FreeBSD on x86_64
  - Linux on x86_64 and x86
  - MacOS X on x86_64 and arm64
  - NetBSD on x86_64
  - OpenBSD on x86_64
  - OpenIndiana on x86_64
  - Windows (including MinGW) on x86_64 and x86

  For a complete list of tested systems and compilers, see the INSTALL file.

- Updated DICOM data dictionary, list of SOP classes, well-known frame of
  references, transfer syntaxes, code definitions, supported context group
  classes, and directory record types for DICOM standard release 2024e.

- The new JPEG XL and HTJ2K transfer syntaxes as well as the
  encapsulated uncompressed transfer syntax are now supported for
  reading/writing. No encoders or decoders are implemented, though.

- Added new command line tool dcm2img that unifies and replaces the tool
  dcm2pnm, dcmj2pnm and dcml2pnm, and adds support for JPEG-LS as an
  export format for image files. The command line options are
  identical to the older tools, so that dcm2img can serve as a
  drop-in replacement.

- Added new command line tool dcm2cda that extracts a CDA document from a
  DICOM Encapsulated CDA Storage SOP Instance and stores it in a separate
  file.

-  Added IPv6 support to DCMTK's association requestors.
   All DCMTK "client" applications that only request outgoing DICOM
   network associations cano now explicitly select the protocol version
   to be used. IPv6 support is not yet implemented for association acceptors
   ("server" applications) yet.

- Various TLS enhancements:

  - Added TLS support in the dcmqrscp and getscu tools.

  - Added support for the Modified BCP 195 RFC 8996 TLS Profile.

  - Added command line options --list-profiles to all TLS enabled tools.
    This option prints a list of the TLS Secure Transport Connection Profiles
    supported.

  - Removed support for OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1.0, added support for
    OpenSSL 3.1.0 to 3.4.0.

- DCMTK now requires compilers to provide conformance to C++ 98
  and supports compilation with newer C++ versions up to C++ 20,
  which can be enabled via CMake's CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD variable.
  By default, C++ 11 is now enabled on compilers that support this.

- The CMake based configure process now respects CMake's
  CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR variable.

- New, fully standards compliant implementations of
  OFStandard::atof() and  OFStandard::ftoa(), DCMTK's locale independent
  conversion routines between floating point numbers and text.

- Removed support for ICU-based charset conversion. Since the oficonv
  module in DCMTK supports all DICOM Specific Character Sets,
  the ICU support, which was never complete, has been removed.

- Many configure tests related to outdated compilers or libraries were
  removed, thus significantly speeding up the configuration process.

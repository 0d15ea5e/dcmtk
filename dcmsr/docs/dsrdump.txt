    dsrdump


SYNOPSIS

    dsrdump: Dump DICOM SR file and data set


SUMMARY

The dsrdump utility dumps the contents of a DICOM Structured Reporting (SR)
document (file format or raw data set) to stdout in textual form.  The output
of the document content follows the format proposed in David Clunie's book
"DICOM Structured Reporting" (which follows the format proposed in earlier
versions of DICOM Supplement 23).

If dsrdump reads a raw data set (DICOM data without a file format
meta-header) it will attempt to guess the transfer syntax by examining
the first few bytes of the file.  It is not always possible to correctly
guess the transfer syntax and it is better to convert a data set to
a file format whenever possible (using the dcmconv utility).  It is
also possible to use the -f and -t[ieb] options to force dsrdump to read
a dataset with a particular transfer syntax.

    +Pc  --print-all-codes      print all codes (incl. concept name codes)


DICOM CONFORMANCE

The dsrdump application supports the following SOP Classes (according to
DICOM Supplement 23 Final Text - Structured Reporting Storage SOP Classes):

    BasicTextSR            "1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.88.11"
    EnhancedSR             "1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.88.22" 
    ComprehensiveSR        "1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.88.33" 


ENVIRONMENT

The dsrdump utility will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries
specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment variable.  By default, if
the DCMDICTPATH environment variable is not set, the file
/usr/local/dicom/lib/dicom.dic will be loaded.  The default behaviour
should be preferred and the DCMDICTPATH environment variable only used
when alternative data dictionaries are required.  The DCMDICTPATH
environment variable has the same format as the shell PATH variable in
that a colon (":") separates entries.  The data dictionary code will
attempt to load each file specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment
variable.  It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.

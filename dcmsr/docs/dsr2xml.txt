    dsr2xml


SYNOPSIS

    dsr2xml: Convert DICOM SR file and data set to XML


SUMMARY

The dsr2xml utility converts the contents of a DICOM Structured Reporting (SR)
document (file format or raw data set) to XML (Extensible Markup Language).
The DTD (Document Type Definition) does not yet follow any standard format.
The dsr2xml application might be enhanced in this aspect in the future (e. g.
by supporting HL7 CDA - Clinical Document Architecture).

If dsr2xml reads a raw data set (DICOM data without a file format
meta-header) it will attempt to guess the transfer syntax by examining
the first few bytes of the file.  It is not always possible to correctly
guess the transfer syntax and it is better to convert a data set to
a file format whenever possible (using the dcmconv utility).  It is
also possible to use the -f and -t[ieb] options to force dsr2xml to read
a dataset with a particular transfer syntax.


USAGE

dsr2xml: Convert DICOM SR file and data set to XML
usage: dsr2xml [options] dsrfile-in [xmlfile-out]

parameters:
  dsrfile-in                   DICOM SR input filename to be converted
  xmlfile-out                  XML output filename (default: stdout)

general options:
  -h     --help                print this help text and exit
  -d     --debug               debug mode, print debug information
input options:
  input file format:
    +f   --read-file           read file format or data set (default)
    -f   --read-dataset        read data set without file meta information
  input transfer syntax (only with --read-dataset):
    -t=  --read-xfer-auto      use TS recognition (default)
    -te  --read-xfer-little    read with explicit VR little endian TS
    -tb  --read-xfer-big       read with explicit VR big endian TS
    -ti  --read-xfer-implicit  read with implicit VR little endian TS
output options:
  encoding:
    +Ev  --attr-value-type     encode value type as XML attribute
    +Er  --attr-relationship   encode relationship type as XML attribute
  writing:
    +We  --write-empty-tags    write all tags even if their value is empty


DICOM CONFORMANCE

The dsr2xml application supports the following SOP Classes (according to
DICOM Supplement 23 Final Text - Structured Reporting Storage SOP Classes):

    BasicTextSR            "1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.88.11"
    EnhancedSR             "1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.88.22" 
    ComprehensiveSR        "1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.88.33" 


ENVIRONMENT

The dsr2xml utility will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries
specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment variable.  By default, if
the DCMDICTPATH environment variable is not set, the file
/usr/local/dicom/lib/dicom.dic will be loaded.  The default behaviour
should be preferred and the DCMDICTPATH environment variable only used
when alternative data dictionaries are required.  The DCMDICTPATH
environment variable has the same format as the shell PATH variable in
that a colon (":") separates entries.  The data dictionary code will
attempt to load each file specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment
variable.  It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.
